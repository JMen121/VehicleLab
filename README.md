# VehicleLab

This repository contains a Java application for a simple vehicle management system, featuring classes for vehicles like Car, Motorcycle, Plane, and a Garage to manage these vehicles. Unit tests are provided for the Car, Vehicle, Motorcycle, Plane, and a Garage classes using JUnit and AssertJ. This repository also used Inhertiance, ArrayList, abstract methods and method overload to create this.

In order to plan this out, a UML Diagram was used in order to identify possible methods and attributes for the abstract classes and the 3 sub classes.
